# Heart_Disease_Prediction
The "Heart Disease Prediction" project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on health data like age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. By applying models such as logistic regression and decision trees, the goal is to build a predictive tool that aids in early diagnosis and prevention.
